# Base schema block

In Airtable, many fields rely on data from other fields: linked records, formulas, lookups, rollups,
and counts. Use this block to create a visual layout of all tables in your base and see all these
relationships together. Gain insight on how data flows between fields in your base. Drag tables
around to customize their arrangement.

## How to remix this block

1. Create a new base (or you can use an existing base).

2. Create a new block in your base (see
   [Create a new block](https://airtable.com/developers/blocks/guides/hello-world-tutorial#create-a-new-block)),
   selecting "Remix from Github" as your template.

3. From the root of your new block, run `block run`.
